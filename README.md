# Sailor Hat for Raspberry Pi (SH-RPi)

## Introduction

The Sailor Hat for Raspberry Pi (SH-RPi) is a versatile power management board designed for the Raspberry Pi and similar single-board computers. With the SH-RPi connected, you can create deeply integrated servers that shut down safely when power is turned off and wake up automatically when power is restored.

SH-RPi supports all Raspberry Pi models with a 40-pin GPIO header (every model since the Pi 1 Model B+). Additionally, it is compatible with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards and other single-board computers that have a 40-pin Raspberry Pi-compatible GPIO header or an external I2C interface with a 5V power input.

The [documentation site](https://docs.hatlabs.fi/sh-rpi/) has details on the hardware and software features of the board.
